Note: We will issue a refund, for a product shipped by Amazon, within a maximum of 14 days and confirm it with an automated e-mail. In certain circumstances refund time frames may be longer. You can see the refund in your bank account or credit card statement, within a maximum of 7 business days after the refund is issued. In certain circumstances refund timeframes may be longer. For more information about our refund policies and how long it will take for you to receive your refund, go to Refunds or contact customer services.
At Amazon.co.uk we want you to have a positive experience every time you shop with us. Occasionally though, we know you may want to return items and you have the right to cancel the purchase of most items within 14 days. You also have statutory rights where goods are not as described, not fit for purpose or not of satisfactory quality.

Mistaken Returns
Please ensure you enclose the correct and complete item when making a return. The correct item must be returned to receive a refund.

If you have accidentally sent the wrong item to Amazon, please contact Customer Service as soon as possible as Amazon does not store mistakenly sent items. Amazon cannot guarantee your item will be found and returned, and no compensation is provided for incorrect items sent to Amazon.

Statutory Cancellation Right
You have the statutory right to cancel your order for any reason within 14 days beginning with the day you receive the item (please see clause 2 of our Conditions of Use & Sale for the full instructions on cancellation and further information on your right of cancellation). To exercise your cancellation right please visit our Returns Support Centre.

Our Voluntary Returns Policy
As well as your statutory cancellation rights described above, you can return most products from the Amazon sites to Amazon within 30 days of receipt of the products if the products are in an unused and undamaged condition. To return an item please visit our Returns Support Centre.

Please note that this returns policy doesn't affect your statutory rights and therefore doesn't affect your right of cancellation as described above.

Please note that you must return each item in the same condition in which you received it. This means that new items must be returned unused and undamaged. Used items must not have any additional signs of use or damage.

The same exclusions apply to our Returns Guarantee as for the right of withdrawal. The following products thus cannot be returned under the Returns Guarantee (unless defective):

Products which are not suitable for return due to health protection or hygienic reasons if unsealed by you after delivery, or which are, after delivery, inseparably mixed with other items;
Sealed audio or video recordings or of sealed software if unsealed by you after delivery;
Goods made to your specifications or clearly personalised, especially personalised Amazon Handmade items;
Goods which may deteriorate or expire rapidly;
A service, if the supplier has fully performed it and you accepted when you placed your order that the supplier could start to deliver it, and that you could not cancel it once delivery had started;
Digital content (including apps, digital software, eBooks, MP3, etc.) which is not supplied on a tangible medium (e.g. on a CD or DVD) if you accepted when you placed your order that the supplier could start to deliver it, and that you could not cancel it once delivery had started. Where an eBook has been partially read or in cases of abuse, refunds may be denied.
Newspapers, journals or magazines with the exception of subscription contracts;
Alcoholic beverages whose actual value is dependent on fluctuations in the market which the supplier cannot control

Returns Costs & Methods
Amazon will refund the cost of sending an item back to us if it was sold or dispatched by Amazon (made-on-demand Collection items from The Drop, that are not defective, damaged or incorrect, are not eligible for free returns. See more information here). In many cases, we’ll provide you with a pre-paid returns label. If the item you purchased is not eligible for Free Return, and you’re using a pre-paid return label, we’ll deduct the cost of the return from your refund. For returns from within the UK, costs start at £3.99. International return costs start at £8.09. Please note that returns that contain multiple items, or large items, may cost more. We offer various returns methods which will differ depending on the item(s) you’re returning. We’ll always display the most accurate return costs and methods available for your item(s) in our Returns Support Centre when you create your label.

You can return items in the following ways:

Using drop off services at locations that are convenient for you.
Using Heavy-Bulky return options, handled by a specialty carrier team.
Using Locker and Amazon Hub Counter locations for small packages.
Using a scanned QR code at designated return locations to make label-free and package-free returns.
To see which options are available for your return, go to Your Orders.

Please note that certain types of items aren't eligible for cancellation or return under the Amazon returns policy. You can find out more in the Conditions of Use & Sale.

We won't accept the return of any software returned to us if it's been opened. We reserve the right to refuse returns or to charge you our fees and expenses if the product isn't received in new, unopened condition.

If a product becomes defective after 30 days you won't be able to create a returns label using our Returns Support Centre - you'll need to Contact Us. You may wish to visit the manufacturer's website or contact them directly as they may be able to offer troubleshooting and support with the issue you have with the product. Please see Manufacturer Contact Details and After Sales Service.

Heavy and Bulky Items
Heavy and bulky Items are items that weigh 31.5kg or more, or whose longest side (when packed) exceeds 175cms When returning heavy and bulky items you will need to arrange for collection. To find out whether the item you want to return needs to be collected, please use our Returns Support Center. .

If the item you have received is damaged, defective or incorrect within 30 days of delivery, you may be entitled to a refund. If so, please visit our help page to Organise a Return Collection.

After 30 days of delivery, you may be entitled to a repair, replacement or refund. If so, you may arrange for a free returns collection. Please visit Warranty Repairs. To contact the manufacturer for help, please visit After Sales Support and Contacting Manufacturers.

For other reasons for return, we may deduct a home collection cost of £50.00 from your refund.

Other Statutory Rights
You have additional rights in relation to incorrect, damaged or defective goods. For more information about these statutory rights, please visit Adviceguide, a Citizens Advice website at http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/.

Defective Items After 30 Days
Troubleshooting and product support may be available to resolve any issues with your product, as outlined in the Product Support Help page. If your item becomes defective after the Amazon return period, Amazon will repair any defective item. The repair will be completed by the manufacturer or by a third-party repair service provider authorised by the manufacturers to repair their products. If a repair is not possible, we'll send you a replacement, and if a replacement is not available, we will refund the purchase price. Repair is only available for qualifying items sold by Amazon.co.uk or Amazon Warehouse. Amazon does not accept a return after 30 days for consumable products (e.g. batteries, fuses, ink, light bulbs, etc.) or if the defect is due to accidental damage, deliberate damage, caused by external factors, or general wear and tear.

Luxury Stores orders can be purchased on Amazon.co.uk, Amazon.de, Amazon.fr, Amazon.it or Amazon.es. Selected Luxury Stores items can be shipped to, and returned from, addresses in the EU and UK. If the item you'd like to purchase is not eligible for delivery outside of the UK, a delivery restriction message will be displayed at the checkout asking you to select a different address instead.

Beauty products made of hazardous materials, including flammable liquids or gases, are not returnable to Amazon. These products will not display a "free returns" message on the product detail page.
Luxury Stores products must be returned in a new (where applicable), unused, and unaltered condition. This includes any attached tags (product tags and security tags), and where applicable, hygiene seals and related accessories. Accessories include but are not limited to; duster bags, garment bags, removable accessories or attachments, spare parts.
Shoes: When trying on shoes, stand on a carpeted surface to protect the soles. The shoebox forms part of the product and should remain intact by placing it in an outer shipping container when sending back to us, otherwise it will not be accepted.
Lingerie & Swimwear: Briefs, swimsuits and bikini bottoms should be tried on over underwear, without removing the protective adhesive strip.
Bags: Please handle light-colored bags and accessories carefully if you are still deciding whether you will be keeping the item. Please note that dark items of clothing can transfer dye to light-colored items.
Product packaging and documentation should also be returned with Luxury Stores products. This includes the brand packaging (provided by the luxury brand directly, different from the Luxury Stores packaging). Additionally, products should be returned in any original protective packaging to prevent damage during return shipping. For product documentation, this includes any certificates of authenticity, warranty cards.
Items must be returned using the return label we provide. In rare cases where a return label is not provided, then please contact the Luxury Stores Customer Service.

If we receive a return of an item different from the item purchased, we may delay the refund to allow time for proper review or dispose of the item without compensation.
Removal of personal data
When returning a product for any reason, you must do so in the exact conditions you received it from Amazon. In this respect you must entirely delete, remove and eliminate all personal data pertaining to you and/or any third party which may be possibly present in same item, and must de-latch any account possibly latched to same item. You will be fully responsible for any data breach that may occur if you fail to do so. You must remove from the returned product and from the box containing the returned product any item not pertaining to the returned product as originally received from Amazon. Amazon will not be responsible for any such items erroneously left by you within the returned product or within the box containing the returned product. You agree and accept that the returned product will become Amazon’s property, and that Amazon is therefore entitled to sell it to third parties at Amazon’s full discretion.

Amazon.co.uk Gift Cards
Amazon.co.uk Gift Cards are non-returnable items. However, unused gift cards may be eligible for a refund by contacting Customer Service.

Other Specific Items
Amazon may sell certain products in unsealed boxes (e.g., for HTC and Huawei), as this is how we receive them. When returning these products to Amazon, you have to send them in the same conditions as received by you, without affixing any seal. Should you send us these products in a sealed box you may be held liable for any data breach or other adverse consequences related to such manumission.
